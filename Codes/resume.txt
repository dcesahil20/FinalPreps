Worked on developing a web based service oriented architecture Data Access / Data Insights Framework (DADIF) from scratch to enable the production and consumption of data in a unified way
Enabled data customers and producers to have set of common tools to manipulate data from different backends (MySQL/Athena/S3)
Different security levels enabled for DADIF
Developed RESTful APIs for communication with DADIF
Created a simple UI for easy interaction with DADIF APIs
Worked on developing custom lambda apps (AWS lambda style)
At core lambda is an app with thin abstraction layer that allows remote execution of core part
Execution engine and storage, implemented different drivers that communicate and use different backends 
Job scheduler : Integrated Apache Airflow for job orchestration
Jobs can be configured dynamically at cadence with configuration stored inside S3
Individual DAGs are created to run at specified cadence, retry and monitor
Enabled functionality to add/remove/update DAGs from UI
DADIF is configured during runtime (ENV vars, secrets, AWS policies, client specific details and permissions as defined in terraform)
Followed rigorous documentation testing process in UAT (User Acceptance Testing) environment befor production code deployment
